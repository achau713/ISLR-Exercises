# Conceptual Exercises

## Question 1

Describe the null hypotheses to which the p-values given in Table 3.4 correspond. Explain what conclusions you can draw based on these p-values. Your explanation should be phrased in terms of sales, TV, radio, and newspaper, rather than in terms of the coefficients of the linear model.

_Solution:_

The null hypotheses to which these p-values correspond to is if the true regression coefficients are zero. Note that there is nothing said about a specified significance levels. We will not state that some coefficients are "significant" vs "non-significant". However, the regression results suggest that for for every $1000 increase in television, radio, and newspaper advertising, there will be an average change in sales by 46, 189, and -1 units, respectively.

## Question 2

Carefully explain the differences between the KNN classifier and KNN regression methods.

_Solution:_  
  
KNN regression is a regression method used to estimate a functional form for a given dataset. It does this by identifying K training observations that are closest to $x_{0}$ (represented by $N_{0}$) and then estimates $f (x_{0})$ by the following formula: $f(x_{0})  = \frac{1}{K} * \sum_{x_{i} \in N_{0}} y_{i}$. That is, KNN regressions averages the response values from all the points in $N_{0}$.

KNN classification is a classification algorithm used to classify observations into different classes within the dataset. The algorithm assigns the observation to the class corresponding to the most common class of its neighboring points.

## Question 3

Suppose we have a data set with five predictors, X1 = GPA, X2 = IQ, X3 = Gender (1 for Female and 0 for Male), X4 = Interaction between GPA and IQ, and X5 = Interaction between GPA and Gender. The response is starting salary after graduation (in thousands of dollars). Suppose we use least squares to fit the model, and get 

$$\begin{align}
\beta_{0} &=  50 \\
\beta_{1} &=  20 \\
\beta_{2} &=  0.07 \\
\beta_{3} &=  35 \\
\beta_{4} &=  0.01 \\
\beta_{5} &=  âˆ’10
\end{align}$$






_Solution:_

We write out the equation:

\[
Salary = 50 + 20 \cdot GPA + 0.07 \cdot IQ + 35 \cdot Gender + 0.01 \cdot (GPA \cdot IQ)  -10 \cdot (GPA \cdot Gender)
\]

a)

To answer this question, we assume that IQ and GPA is fixed. Then, we write the equation for males and for females

_Equation for males given fixed IQ and GPA:_

\[
Salary = 50 + 20 \cdot GPA + 0.07 \cdot IQ + 0.01 \cdot (GPA \cdot IQ)
\]

_Equation for females given fixed IQ and GPA:_

\[
\begin{align}
Salary & =  50 + 20 \cdot GPA + 0.07 \cdot IQ + 35 + 0.01 \cdot (GPA \cdot IQ)  -10 \cdot GPA\\
& =  85 + 20 \cdot GPA + 0.07 \cdot IQ + 0.01 \cdot (GPA \cdot IQ)  -10 \cdot GPA
\end{align}
\]
